Another Pong game for PC  :-)

The goal of this project was teaching computer programming to my father, while doing something fun. Although my father did not learn programming, at least we had a few joyfull moments together and a nice game. As he is a very good musician, he wrote a great music for the game. It was compiled for Microsof Windows.
